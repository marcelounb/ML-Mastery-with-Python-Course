        "*   Generally k-fold cross validation is the gold standard for evaluating the performance of a machine learning algorithm on unseen data with k set to 3, 5, or 10.\n",
        "*   Using a train/test split is good for speed when using a slow algorithm and produces performance estimates with lower bias when using large datasets.\n",
        "*   Techniques like leave-one-out cross validation and repeated random splits can be useful intermediates when trying to balance variance in the estimated performance, model training speed and dataset size.\n",
        " \n",
        "The best advice is to experiment and ﬁnd a technique for your problem that is fast and produces reasonable estimates of performance that you can use to make decisions. If in doubt, use 10-fold cross validation."
